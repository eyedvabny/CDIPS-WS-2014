### Sample script

At the Kaggle [page](www.kaggle.com/c/avito-prohibited-content/data) they provide a sample script that we can use as a starting point for further optimiztion. Though the script is extremely useful, it is quite hard to understand. I spent some time to figure out how the data is processed. The flowchart can be seen here:

At the same time, I have uploaded a version of the script that has been heavily commented to make the code easier to understand (or maybe it is just more messy?).

Feel free to clean it further up!
